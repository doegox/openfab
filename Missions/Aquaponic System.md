# Aquaponic system for the lab
*Description (max 500 characters, will be revisited to fit the whole storyline)*  
*Observation?* 

Could be cool to have an aquaponic system at the lab, as an exemple of what we can do, as an ecosystem we can explore with, as a nice refreshing decorative and source of green for cooking or drinking.
